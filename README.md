# Tensorflow
During our extending spring break, I decided to start getting hands on training with Machine Learning in Tensorflow. I will cover what I have learned Machine Learning with Tensorflow course taughtr taking Freecodecamp's recently released  by Tim from "Tech with Tim". As a Data Science newbie, this course really helped me to get a great overview of Machine Learning and to get hands-on practice with a few datasets and to get ideas on how they can be used for future projects in my Masters in Data Science program!
