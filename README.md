# Hands on Training in Tensorflow
During our extending spring break, I decided to start getting hands on training with Machine Learning in Tensorflow. I will cover what I have learned in the Machine Learning with Tensorflow course from Freecodecamp and taught by Tim from "Tech with Tim". This course really helped me to get a great overview of Machine Learning and to get hands-on practice with a few datasets and to get ideas on how they can be used for future projects in my Data Science MS program!
